## How to install:
Run these following commands.
```
virtualenv venv --python=python3
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

# Todo
- Add Commenting.
- Possibile Optimizations.
- - Scrap all prices from same page?
- Add Commands, "python3 main.py checkthisdomain.com"
- Django Application
- - Dashboard with approval, sends user to checkout page?
- - Stores within a Database, constantly running in the background using Docker.
- - Possible auto buy when approved instead of sending to a checkout page?
